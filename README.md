# Introduction
This AWS Lambda function works with a FortiGate Automation Action and an API gateway to change the security group of a requested EC2 instance to one specified in an environment variable.

# Set up the AWS Lambda function

> **Note:** The FortiGate and the AWS Lambda function will need to be in the same AWS region, i.e us-east-2. The FortiGate will automatically set the AWS region for the POST request based on the AWS region it is set up in.

  1. In the AWS Console, select **Services > Compute > Lambda**.
  2. Click **Create (a) function**.
  3. Select **Author from scratch** and enter **Basic information** as follows:
     * **Function name:** Enter a function name of your choosing.
     * **Runtime:** Select **Node.js 8.10**.
     * **Permissions:** Select an existing role, or create a new one. The function will need basic **AWS Lambda Execution** as well as EC2 **Describe** and **Modify**. The JSON below can be used to create policies with these permissions.

     **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole:**
      ```
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                    "logs:CreateLogStream",
                    "logs:PutLogEvents"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
      }
      ```

     **EC2 Describe and Modify JSON:**

      ```
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                    "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
      }
      ```

  4. Click **Create function** to create the function.
  5. Under **Function code**, copy the provided `index.js` code into the AWS Lambda function.
  6. Under **Environment variables** add the following key-value pair:
     * **Key:** DEFAULT_GROUP.
     * **Value:** The security group that EC2 instances will be reset to.
  7. Click **Save** (top right) to save changes to the AWS Lambda function.
  8. Under **Designer** click **API Gateway** and configure the trigger as follows:
     * **API:** Select **Create a new API**.
     * **Security:** Select **Open with API key**.
  9. Click **Add**.
  10. Click **Save** (top right) to save changes to the API Gateway.
  11. Make note of the **API endpoint** and the **API key**, as they will be used in the next section.

# Set up the FortiGate

  1. Log into your FortiGate.
  2. Select **Security Fabric > Automation**.
  3. Click **Create New**.
  4. Enter a **Name**.
  5. Under **Trigger**, select **Compromised Host**.
  6. Under **Action**, select **AWS Lambda**. If desired, an email notification can be configured to notify you that the event has triggered. (Select **Email** and configure appropriately).
  7. Under **AWS Lambda**, set the **API gateway** and **API key** with the values generated in the previous section.

An example is shown below.
